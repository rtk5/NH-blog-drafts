# Welcome to College: You're Now in the Algorithm

Hey freshers, and hello to the rest of you seniors who are basically running on caffeine, deadlines, and whatever confidence you had before grades humbled you into oblivion.

So, you've joined college. You've got dreams, ambitions, and a new laptop that you swear you're going to use for "productive work" — welcome to the world of AIML, where the code compiles 10% of the time, and the rest of the time you're just debugging your own life choices (kind of like me during mechanical ESA, staring at some PDF called MECHANICAL_COMBINED_SLIDES at 1 a.m., wondering why I exist).

## Let's be real:

College is basically a giant neural network. First year is data preprocessing (removing bad habits… or adding new ones). Second year is training (overfitting on random tutorials you'll never revisit). Third year is hyperparameter tuning (a.k.a. freaking out about internships). And final year? That's just inference mode — praying your model (a.k.a. you) works in the real world (spoiler: it's more like barely compiling).

## But here's the problem:

Most of us are in default mode — running in the great rat race. Spending three days researching "best ML course for beginners" and zero days actually starting one. Doing deep learning because it sounds deep. Building a chatbot because… well, ChatGPT is the buzzword of the decade. Before you know it, you've got around 10 GitHub repos named "final_final_version_REAL" and no clue what half of them do.

**We forget the "why."**

Why did we even start learning ML? Was it curiosity? Was it to make something cool? Or was it just because LinkedIn made us feel like unemployed trash at 19 (btw, it still does)

## Here's my hot take:

You don't have to be the fastest rat. You just have to be the curious one. Build ridiculous projects. Make the world's worst classifier. Train a model that predicts your GPA based on the number of classes you slept through. Fail spectacularly, laugh about it, then fix it. That's how you actually learn.

Because one day, when you graduate, you'll realize something important:

**There was never really a finish line — just a lot of strange, frustrating, surprisingly fun checkpoints along the way.**

And if you remember nothing else from this rant, remember this: it's better to trip on a path you chose than to sprint down one you don't understand. Slow down, look around, and maybe — just maybe — start running your own algorithm.
